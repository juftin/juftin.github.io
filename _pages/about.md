## Hey, I'm juftin (Justin Flannery) <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px">

I'm a ~~Software and Data Engineer~~ Machine Learning Operations Engineer based out of Denver, Colorado, USA.

My work with data has spanned from being on the front lines building out Tableau reports to
architecting machine learning recommendation pipelines. Currently, I work as part of an MLOps team
looking to empower our data scientists to leverage ML in production. I'm very interested in big data
engineering, distributed systems, and everything open source
(especially the Apache projects).

When I'm not coding you can find me camping with my partner and our two dogs, catching a bluebird day
skiing in Colorado, or soaking up the sun at a Bluegrass concert.
