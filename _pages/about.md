## Hey, I'm juftin (Justin Flannery) <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px">

I'm a software engineer and Python developer based out of Denver, Colorado, USA.

My work with data has spanned from being on the front lines building out Tableau reports to
architecting machine learning recommendation systems. Currently, I work as part of an software
engineering team looking to make heart attacks a thing of the past using machine learning. I'm very
interested in machine learning operations, big data engineering, distributed systems, and everything
open source.

When I'm not coding you can find me camping with my partner and our two dogs, catching a bluebird
day skiing in Colorado, or soaking up the sun at a bluegrass concert.
