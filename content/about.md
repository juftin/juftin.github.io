## Hey, I'm juftin (Justin Flannery) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and Python developer with a focus on data engineering
and machine learning operations - based out of Denver, Colorado, USA.

My work with data has spanned from being on the front lines as an analyst and data
scientist, building out data platforms, architecting machine learning recommendation
systems, and working on scalable applications as a backend and platform engineer.
Currently, I work as part of a software engineering team looking to make heart
attacks a thing of the past using machine learning.

Iâ€™m very interested in machine learning operations (MLOps), big data engineering,
distributed systems, large language models, and everything open source. Check out
my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/juftin) to see my personal contributions to the open source
community.

When Iâ€™m not coding you can find me camping with my partner and our two dogs,
catching a bluebird day skiing in Colorado, or soaking up the sun at a
bluegrass concert.
