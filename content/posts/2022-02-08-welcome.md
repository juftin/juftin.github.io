When I was setting up my portfolio site I realized that it also has some pretty nifty blogging
capabilities too. Well... I guess I have a blog now.

I'm not typically one to channel my energy through writing so I don't expect to be extremely active
on here but it's nice to have a venue where I can record my thoughts from time to time.

In the meantime I'll begin to work on putting together some more content to showcase some of my open
source work.

Thanks for being here

```python
def introduce_myself(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Say Hi to everyone
    """
    intro = (f"Hey everyone, I'm {name}. "
             "It's really nice to be here")
    print(intro)
    return intro


if __name__ == "__main__":
    introduce_myself(name="juftin")
